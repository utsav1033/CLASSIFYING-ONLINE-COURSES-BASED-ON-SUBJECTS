#Automated Customer Review Classification for Enhanced Feedback Analysis
Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering

#Project Overview
This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for Semester 6 students at Pillai College of Engineering. The objective is to automatically classify customer reviews into predefined categories such as Quality, Shipping, and Service. The classification is performed using Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Transformer-based Language Models.
The project involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation to determine the most effective approach for customer review classification. By implementing different classification techniques, we aim to improve feedback analysis and help businesses identify areas for improvement.

#Project Title
Automated Customer Review Classification for Enhanced Feedback Analysis

#Project Abstract
The project focuses on automatically categorizing customer reviews into different categories (Quality, Shipping, and Service) to facilitate better understanding of consumer satisfaction and improve business operations. The classification is performed using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Transformer-based models, such as BERT and GPT.
The dataset consists of 1,050 customer reviews, each with a unique review ID, the review text, and its corresponding category. By applying techniques such as text vectorization, feature engineering, and model optimization, we aim to improve classification accuracy and efficiency. The comparative analysis of traditional ML models, deep learning architectures, and language models provides insights into their effectiveness in handling customer review classification tasks.
