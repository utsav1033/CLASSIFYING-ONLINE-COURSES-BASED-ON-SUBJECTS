# Automated Customer Review Classification for Enhanced Feedback Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** course for **Semester 6** students at **Pillai College of Engineering**. The objective is to automatically classify customer reviews into predefined categories such as **Quality, Shipping, and Service** using **Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Transformer-based Language Models**.

The project involves the following steps:
- **Text Preprocessing**
- **Feature Extraction**
- **Model Training**
- **Performance Evaluation**

By implementing different classification techniques, we aim to enhance **feedback analysis** and help businesses identify areas for improvement.

## Project Abstract
The project focuses on automatically categorizing **customer reviews** into different categories (**Quality, Shipping, and Service**) to facilitate better understanding of consumer satisfaction and improve business operations.

The classification is performed using:
- **Machine Learning**
- **Deep Learning**
- **Transformer-based Models** (e.g., **BERT** and **GPT**)

### **Dataset Details:**
- **1,050 customer reviews**
- **Unique Review ID**
- **Review Text**
- **Corresponding Category**

We apply techniques such as **text vectorization, feature engineering, and model optimization** to improve classification accuracy and efficiency. The comparative analysis of **traditional ML models, deep learning architectures, and language models** provides insights into their effectiveness in handling customer review classification tasks.
